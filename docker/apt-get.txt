  purge - Remove packages and config files
  autoremove - Remove automatically all unused packages
  dist-upgrade - Distribution upgrade, see apt-get(8)
  dselect-upgrade - Follow dselect selections
  build-dep - Configure build-dependencies for source packages
  satisfy - Satisfy dependency strings
  clean - Erase downloaded archive files
  autoclean - Erase old downloaded archive files
  check - Verify that there are no broken dependencies
  source - Download source archives
  download - Download the binary package into the current directory
  changelog - Download and display the changelog for the given package

apt 2.0.9 (amd64)
Usage: apt-cache [options] command
       apt-cache [options] show pkg1 [pkg2 ...]

apt-cache queries and displays available information about installed
and installable packages. It works exclusively on the data acquired
into the local cache via the 'update' command of e.g. apt-get. The
displayed information may therefore be outdated if the last update was
too long ago, but in exchange apt-cache works independently of the
availability of the configured sources (e.g. offline).

Most used commands:
  showsrc - Show source records
  search - Search the package list for a regex pattern
  depends - Show raw dependency information for a package
  rdepends - Show reverse dependency information for a package
  show - Show a readable record for the package
  pkgnames - List the names of all packages in the system
  policy - Show policy settings

apt 2.0.9 (amd64)
Usage: apt-sortpkgs [options] file1 [file2 ...]

apt-sortpkgs is a simple tool to sort package information files.
By default it sorts by binary package information, but the -s option
can be used to switch to source package ordering instead.

See apt-sortpkgs(1) for more information about the available commands.
